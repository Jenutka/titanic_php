# Rubix ML - Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

![Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](/images/img_titanic.jpg)

An example Rubix ML project that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using a Random Forest clasiffier and a very famous dataset from a [Kaggle competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). In this tutorial, you'll learn about classification and advanced preprocessing techniques. By the end of the tutorial, you'll be able to submit your own predictions to the Kaggle competition.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Training time:** Minutes

From Kaggle:

> This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions
>
> The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
> 
> In this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.
>
> Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
>
> The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.
>
> Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
