# Rubix ML - Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

![Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](/images/img_titanic.jpg)

An example Rubix ML project that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using a Random Forest clasiffier and a very famous dataset from a [Kaggle competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). In this tutorial, you'll learn about classification and advanced preprocessing techniques. By the end of the tutorial, you'll be able to submit your own predictions to the Kaggle competition.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Training time:** Minutes

From Kaggle:

> This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions
>
> The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
> 
> In this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

## Installation

$ composer create-project rubix/titanic
```

## Requirements
- [PHP](https://php.net) 7.4 or above

#### Recommended
- [Tensor extension](https://github.com/RubixML/Tensor) for faster training and inference
- 1G of system memory or more
